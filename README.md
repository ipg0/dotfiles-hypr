# My Hyprland dotfiles

Entirely my own config, inspired by a lot of different things at once.
The dotfiles are a bit messy, and the scripts have some weird dependencies, so use/modify with caution.

## Config:
- OS: Ubuntu
- WM: Hyprland
- Sound/Video: PipeWire
- Shell: fish + tmux
- Terminal: kitty
- Notifications: swaync
- Bar: waybar
- Menus: wofi
- Lock screen: swaylock-effects
- File manager: xplr
- Web browser: Vivaldi
- VS Code theme: Potpourri Contrast (rainglow) from Rainglow Themes extension
- GTK theme: Yaru Magenta Dark because I don't use many GTK apps so I didn't bother
- Vivaldi theme: Robots with background image replaced
- Font: Ubuntu Nerd Font
- Wallpaper: a random picture I took out of a window years ago (super noisy)
- Colour scheme: just a set of colours that I like
- Custom scripts in Ruby, of all languages: present
